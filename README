This is a preview alpha of the mashups module to help developers learn about how to create a SilverStripe module,
and to allow adventureous hackers to try out and improve the module. More documentation will follow shortly.

This is part of the Google Summer of Code, and is being written by Lakshan Perera. (http://www.silverstripe.com/Lakshan-Perera/)

To install, 

1. rename the extracted directory to "mashups" and place in the root of your silverstripe installation.
I.e. you will now have the following root folders

assets
mysite
cms
jsparty
mashups

2. Run /db/build/

3. The CMS should now have "Flickr Gallery" and "Mashup Sample" page types.
Add these and visit them on the public site.

Please raise issues, bugs, contributions in the forum - see http://www.silverstripe.com/google-summer-of-code-forum/flat/1931

3. Read the developer documentation:
 - http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=gsoc07mashups
 - Base class: http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=restfulservice
 - Flickr Service: http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=flickrservice
 
 Note : To use the FlickrGallery or FlickrService you'll require an API-key from Flickr.
 You can easily obtain one from the following URL : http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/
 Place your API key in _config.php of this module, (FlickrService::setAPIKey('c88164229499662e1497335950c61eeb'); )
