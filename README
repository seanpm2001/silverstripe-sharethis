This is a preview alpha of the ShareThis module which will enable automatically inserting Social Bookmarks on Silverstripe sites.

This is part of the Google Summer of Code, and is being written by Lakshan Perera. (http://www.silverstripe.com/Lakshan-Perera/)

To install, 

1. rename the extracted directory to "sharethis" and place in the root of your silverstripe installation.
I.e. you will now have the following root folders

assets
mysite
cms
jsparty
mashups

2. Run /db/build/

3. Configure the module for your preference by editing _config.php (you could select the icons you want to appear)

4. Add the variable '$ShareThis' to the position you want to display the icons in your page template. (This step is REQUIRED to display the icons) 

5. You could enable the ShareThis icons for each page via the CMS (to enable Go to Behaviour Tab and select the ShareThis checkbox)
